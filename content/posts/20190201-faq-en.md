**<font color="#03a9f4">Q: Why do I need CMT Wallet to vote?</font>**

A: The voting rule is that one CMT equal to one vote, and one CMT can only vote once. Therefore, each vote must be signed with the CMT holder's private key and recorded on CyberMiles blockchain. CMT Wallet is the easiest tool to create and submit a voting signature.


**<font color="#03a9f4">Q: Why do I need to pay for gas?</font>**

A: The CommunityVote DApp is built on the CyberMiles public blockchain. Your vote will be verified by the validators (Supernodes) and be recorded on the blockchain, so you need to pay the Supernodes for the gas fee.

In addition, the Lity language is undergoing new feature development, which will support the contract creator to pay for the gas fee. That will eliminate the need for users to pay gas in future votes. 


**<font color="#03a9f4">Q: Why can't I vote directly with the CMT Cube?</font>**

A: The CMT Cube has the private key of the account, but there is no user interface that supports the Community Vote DApp. Therefore, the only way to vote from CMT Cube is to import the latter to a CMT Wallet. For more details on how to import CMT Cube's private key/mnemonic into CMT Wallet, please refer to ["Import a CMT Cube account into a CMT Wallet (the mnemonic method)"](https://cybermiles.cdn.prismic.io/cybermiles%2Fe5b18263-46f1-4cac-9211-c8b118d26bae_import+a+cmt+cube+account+into+a+cmt+wallet+%28the+mnemonic+method%29.pdf) and ["Import a CMT Cube account into CMT Wallet (the private key method)"](https://cybermiles.cdn.prismic.io/cybermiles%2Fcb3c9f3a-c6fa-4160-a43f-2b7ab94a9cb3_import+a+cmt+cube+account+into+cmt+wallet+%28the+private+key+method%29.pdf). Please remember to protect the mnemonic and private key during the import process.

Note that staked CMTs can also be used as a vote but you will need to leave **at least one unstaked CMT** to pay for the vote-related gas fee. 


**<font color="#03a9f4">Q: Will importing CMT Cube CMTs into CMT Wallet unstake my CMTs in the Cube?</font>**

A: No. After importing your CMTs, the CMT Cube and CMT Wallet will point to the same address. Your CMTs are still staked and continue to receive block rewards.


**<font color="#03a9f4">Q: What if I have different CMT addresses?</font>**

A: You can vote from one address at a time, and then switch to another address to vote again, using the multi-wallet function from CMT Wallet for example, or using different devices.
