The CyberMiles public blockchain has a unique governance structure. We have a transparent process for validator nodes to vote on on-chain governance issues such as software upgrades, stolen fund recovery, economic parameter changes etc. 


Today, we are announcing a new DApp on the CyberMiles blockchain to support community inputs on important governance issues related to the CyberMiles Foundation. 


The CyberMiles Foundation developed the Community Vote DApp to allow CMT holders, hence the CMT Community, to share with us thoughts and opinions on governance matters. As a community, we work together to make CyberMiles better. It is also a key element for CyberMiles community autonomy.


[CMT Wallet](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/blockchain-infrastructure/cmt-wallet/) is the only tool to partucupite in the commnunity governance votes.
