**Should the CyberMiles Foundation withdraw its stakes from validators?**

_The voting has concluded. The CMT community voted for YES. [The results are recorded on the CyberMiles public blockchain](http://cmtvote.codeislaw.co/)_

The CyberMiles Foundation has staked most of its CMTs, including those still in lock-up period to CyberMiles validators. The main reason to do so is to reduce extra CMT supply (and sell side pressure) caused by the systematic inflation. The awards generated by foundation stakes are locked up in the Foundation account and will not be available in the open market for at least a year. When the awards are unlocked in the future, the Foundation promises to consult the community and only use the income in community building expenditures.

However, validators and CMT Cube holders have voiced their concerns to the Foundation. They feel that the Foundation staking unfairly reduces their staking income. Should the Foundation withdraw its stakes?
