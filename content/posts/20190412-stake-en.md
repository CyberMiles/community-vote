Based on the suggestions from the CMT Community, the CyberMiles Foundation would like to initiate a community vote on whether we should support DPoS staking from the CMT Wallet. 

The voting rules are as follows. 


* CMT Wallet is the only tool to vote;
* To participate in voting, you should hold at least 1,000 CMTs;
* 1 CMT per vote;
* Each CMT address can only vote once;


This community vote starts on 6 AM, April 14ï¼Œand will end on 2 AM, April 17(UTC).
